MeterReadings
==============

I primarily started this project to refresh my Rails skills and to satisfy my obsession for statistics, but it is nonetheless fully-functional. You can manage your electricity or water meters, watch your monthly consumption in nice charts, see your monthly and yearly costs and check whether your current reading of the meter matches the estimation, so whether you're above or below your average consumption.
